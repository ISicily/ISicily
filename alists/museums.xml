                        prehistoric and Iron Age material from Polizzello is complemented by the 5th
                        and 4th centuries BC material from Monte Raffe. NB some of the items on

                    <desc>An eclectic collection of antiquities, ranging from large architectural
                        pieces (marble columns, column capitals, architraves) through sculpture
                        (bronze and marble) and ceramics (red figure, black figure, Centuripe ware,
                        numerous shapes, sizes, many fragments, including some superb pieces) to
                        small finds (a great collection of strigils and fibulae) and coins. This was
                        part of the collection of Prince Ignazio Biscari, and was in the house when
                        the current owner bought it sight unseen in 1968. He has permission from the
                        state to retain the collection, and it is recognised as being in his private
                        ownership. The collection is partly in the villa itself, and partly in the
                        gardens and a series of purpose-built structures. The archaeological
                        collection is mixed in with a vast collection amassed by the owner
                        (principally art and sculpture of more modern periods, and weaponry)</desc>

                        tragic theatre masks) that are near unique</desc>

                    <desc>The collection consists of 3 rooms lined with cases, all deriving from the
                        excavations in the internal courtyard of Palazzo Zanca. They begin with the
                        most recent material and progress to the earliest. The material largely
                        dates to the 11-15 centuries AD, but a large Roman public building of
                        monumental construction was uncovered in the earliest layer reached. A
                        single case is devoted to this period, with 9 groups of artefacts in it
                        (fragments of amphora, terra sigilata, crustae, mosaic flooring). Excellent
                        information boards throughout</desc>

                        (possibly ancient) and the remains of ancient inhabitation, some of which
                        were subsequently built into his garden features. There are loomweights,
                        ceramics and other small finds, mixed in with a lovely collection of modern
                        art. No provenance given for any of the ancient material, although it is

                        exploration of the area, then covers the surrounding sites and moves

                        Medieval period and the process of transforming the ruined castle into the
                        present museum. Further rooms have just been renovated and will be opened

                    <desc>Exhibition was formed in the early 2000s from chance finds in the area of
                        the necropolis of Hykana (identification not yet confirmed) dating from 7th
                        to 4th centuries BC. The location of the settlement site is not yet clear.
                        The Soprintendenza became involved to stop the Tombaroli and took the
                        material gathered to the Salinas, from which it was returned to Montelepre
                        when a sufficient space was allocated for it. Nicely exhibited, a lovely
                        collection in a series of cases. Principally ceramic, in good condition,
                        some lithic finds.</desc>

                    <desc>The collection has been recently redisplayed and renovated, and is a
                        superb example of the museological tradition in Sicily. Maps and information
                        boards provide context for well chosen pieces from the surrounding region.
                        The first few rooms are organised chronologically and by site, with an
                        occasional focus on particular object categories (e.g. Obsidian). They begin
                        with the Neolithic and proceed through the Bronze age and Archaic periods
                        before the main room (which concentrates on ancient Phintias) which looks at
                        the acropolis, urban topography and domestic quarters. A room underneath the
                        main room displays the famous golden jewellery and coins found in
                        Phintias</desc>

                        progresses through the different areas and periods of the city, focusing at
                        the end on the sculpture and inscriptions. The accompanying boards set the
                        objects into a clear historical context. One of the highlights of the
                        collection is the aforementioned warship ram. Two other objects given
                        prominence are two of the four Oscan inscriptions in the collection, from
                        the time of Mamertine domination. The principle display cases focus on the
                        cemeteries and religious areas of the city. The grounds of the museum
                        contain a number of monuments and architectural pieces (many from the
                        post-medieval city that was destroyed in the 1908 earthquake) but some

                        extensive Malacological collections in the world (2) a neat and modern
                        display of archaeological material (entitled from Village to Palace)
                        excavated in and around Menfi. There is a lot of 10th-13th centuries AD
                        material, but also a lot of Late Roman material from the cemeteries. Mostly
                        ceramics, with few dates, but otherwise lengthy descriptions. It is intended
                        that the building will eventually house other exhibits, in particular the
                        Portopalo shipwreck once it is studied and published.</desc>

                        their surface decoration, and there is an understandable focus on the metal
                        items (gold and iron) and the stone stele and moulded bases. The collection
                        is arranged over 4 rooms and one corridor on two levels of a restored

                        juxtaposed neatly with architectural elements from the Temple. The displays
