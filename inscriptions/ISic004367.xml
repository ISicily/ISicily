                                    <p>A bronze rostrum (ram), constructed in a single casting, consisting of a
                                        tailpiece, driving head and cowl, designed to be fitted over the wale and keel
                                        timbers at the bow of a warship. Large nails secured the ram to the timbers. The
                                        head of the ram is distinguished by three fins, forming the shape of trident in
                                        relief on the sides of the head. The upper surface of the cowl nosing is
                                        distinguished by a relief of a winged victory at the top, and below that a Latin
                                        inscription in relief letters. The ram weighs approximately 125 kg.</p>

                                    <p>The text occupies two lines, left to right, on the upper face of the cowl, and is
                                        read from the starboard side. The upper face of the cowl (concave) is 940 mm
                                        long, wider at the top, narrowing towards the head (88 mm wide at the start of
                                        the text, 47 mm wide at the end of the text). As with #4, on the upper part of
                                        the face is a moulded relief of a winged victory, carrying a laurel crown in
                                        right hand and palm frond in left. In contrast to #4, there is a small amount of
                                        blank space above and below the winged victory. As with the Egadi 4 ram, the
                                        inscription is moulded and cast, constituting part of the original casting of
                                        the ram along with the relief decoration. The letters are in strong relief (3-4
                                        mm high). The text occupies a length of 483 mm; line 1 is shorter, with a vacat
                                        following, but the final two letters of line 2 are significantly larger than
                                        those preceding and fill most of the available field. Blank space follows the
                                        text. The surface is in very good condition, and after cleaning the text is
                                        clear and the letters sharp.</p>

                                <p>The letters of line 1 are between 25 and 36 mm in height, largest at the beginning,
                                    and reducing significantly in size after the first six letters: the first six
                                    letters are 31-36 mm; the last five letters are 25-27 mm in height. In line 2, the
                                    initial M is 38 mm high, the remainder, excluding the final two, are between 33 and
                                    25 mm, reducing steadily in height as the line proceeds. The second O is incomplete,
                                    as its base projected over the edge of the cowl face and was cut off in the making
                                    of the mould. The final two letters (Q and P) are 36 and 33 mm in height and sit
                                    higher in the field. They are not therefore the largest letters in the inscription,
                                    although they may appear so to the naked eye as a result of the text layout.
                                    Interpuncts are formed by circular dots (also in relief) and are placed between
                                    every word, but not at line end. Letter forms: M is formed by sloping hastae, with
                                    the middle point touching the baseline; P is rectilinear and open, with the right
                                    vertical slightly less than half the length of the left; O fills the full letter
                                    height; L is sharply hooked; F has equal horizontal bars; Q has a near horizontal
                                    tail coming off bottom right; A has broken bar; E has a slightly shorter middle bar;
                                    R has a closed and rounded head, the tail does not extend to the baseline.</p>

                <p>Gaius Papirius, son of Tiberius, (and) Marcus Publicius, son of Lucius, quaestors, approved (this
                    ram)</p>
            </div>
            <div type="commentary">
                <p>The names are in the abbreviated archaic nominative in –o(s). The names themselves are both
                    well-attested archaic forms: Paperios for classical Papirius, Populicios for classical Publicius.
                    The expansion of the abbreviation Q. P. appears to be straightforward, as suggested by the text of
                    Egadi 7, 8 and 10. It is difficult to imagine in the context that Q can stand for anything other
                    than quaestor (as an abbreviation it is extremely common). On the other hand, it is rare to find the
                    verb probare abbreviated to p alone, and without the parallels of #7, #8 and #10 the resolution
                    might not have been so obvious. It is normal for an office to be listed once to cover a list of
                    multiple individuals, but typically this is done by placing the office at the end of the list of
                    names, and commonly on a new line. However, parallels for the layout found here can be adduced.
                    Orthographic elements suggest a relatively early date: the second declension nominative form in os,
                    and the archaic forms of the names Publicius and Papirius. Likewise the letter forms are suggestive
                    of a mid-Republican date (third or early second century BC).</p>
                <p>M. Publicius L. f. L. n. Malleolus (RE 22) was consul in 232 BC. The omission of the cognomen is
                    unremarkable. Although we know of a number of other Publicii in this period, no other M. Publicius
                    L. f. is attested, and only a dozen Publicii in total are attested holding office under the
                    Republic; a small number of other holders of the name is also known (notably, an M. Populicios M. f.
                    in a third-century dedication from the Tiber island). We know from literary sources that the consul
                    of 232 also held the aedileship alongside his brother L. Publicius in either 241 or 238 BC. The date
                    provides a terminus ante quem for his quaestorship, but greater precision is difficult. It was
                    normal for a year to intervene between the holding of magistracies, even at this relatively early
                    date, but the evidence is almost non-existent for the lesser magistracies such as the quaestorship.
                    There is no basis for reconstructing a ‘standard’ cursus in this period, as the praetorship was not
                    yet a standard step in the cursus (the second praetorship was only instituted c. 242 BC), and the
                    aedileship was never compulsory. Third-century evidence for the place of the quaestorship in the
                    cursus is negligible. In the second century we know of 18 individuals whose quaestorship can be
                    dated (sometimes only approximately) and who went on to hold the consulship. In three cases the
                    interval was, or may have been, less than 10 years. Attested intervals otherwise range from 12 to 21
                    years, with 7 cases of 12-14 years and 8 cases of 16-21 years. It is therefore most likely that the
                    consul of 232 BC held his quaestorship some time in the 240s, and possible that he held it as early
                    as the late 250s. In this respect, it is relevant to consider that one plausible explanation for the
                    presence of mostly Roman/Latin inscribed rostra on the sea-bed, at the site of what was a Roman
                    victory, is that the rams were all from Roman ships previously captured by the Carthaginians in
                    earlier battles (in particular at the battle of Drepanum in 249 BC, when the Carthaginians seized 93
                    Roman ships and took them back to Carthage (Polyb. 1.51.12, 53.1)); those ships and rams would then
                    have been in reuse by the Carthaginians as part of their emergency resupply fleet of 241 BC which
                    was sunk by the Romans at the Egadi islands. If that explanation holds truth (and it is attractive
                    for several reasons), then in order to identify the quaestor Publicius of Egadi 4, 6, and 11 with
                    the consul of 232 BC we require a gap of at least 17 years between quaestorship and consulship,
                    since the construction round which he supervised would have to have been in 250/49 BC at the latest,
                    and not that for the new Roman fleet of 242/1 BC. As we have seen, such an interval does find
                    parallels in the second century, and should therefore be entertained as a possibility. Further
                    support for this possibility comes from the fact that Publicius, as the plebeian consul of 232 BC,
                    was the only member of his family ever to reach the consulship, and therefore a significant delay in
                    his reaching the top of the cursus is by no means out of the question. The identification of course
                    cannot be proven, however likely it may seem.</p>
                <p>C. Papirius Ti. f. cannot be identified. The family of the Papirii (branches bearing the cognomina
                    Cursor and Crassus) held high office in the early Republic, and in the third century the Papirii
                    Masones came to prominence, including the consul of 231 BC, C. Papirius C. f. L. n. Maso (RE 57);
                    several other branches of the family are also attested, including the Carbones of the later
                    Republic. However, the praenomen Tiberius is only attested once in the entire gens, for a military
                    tribune with consular powers of 380 BC, Tiberius Papirius Crassus (RE 50).</p>
